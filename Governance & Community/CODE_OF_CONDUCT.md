## Special Note: Safety-Critical Context

Given that NER-Aegis AI deals with **life-safety decisions**:

- Assume good faith in discussions about safety concerns
- Welcome questioning of assumptions
- Document concerns clearly and professionally
- Remember: criticism of code is not criticism of people

When lives are at stake, rigorous review is compassion.
